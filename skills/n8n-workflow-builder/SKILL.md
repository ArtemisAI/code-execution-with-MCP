# n8n Workflow Builder Skill

A reusable skill for building n8n workflows using the code execution paradigm.

## Description

This skill demonstrates how to build n8n workflows programmatically using the filesystem-based tool discovery pattern. It shows token-efficient patterns for discovering nodes, validating configurations, and creating workflows.

## Usage

```javascript
const { buildSlackNotificationWorkflow } = require('./skill.js');

// Build a Slack notification workflow
const workflow = await buildSlackNotificationWorkflow({
  channel: '#alerts',
  webhookPath: '/alert'
});

console.log(`Created workflow: ${workflow.id}`);
```

## Token Efficiency

This skill uses progressive disclosure to minimize token usage:

- Discovers only needed nodes (~200 tokens vs 50,000)
- Uses essentials instead of full node info
- Validates before creating
- Filters and processes data in code
